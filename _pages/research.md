My research centers primarily on team demographic diversity and composition. Accordingly, most of my projects are focused on teamwork, diversity, and the intersection of these two areas in organizational settings. You can find a summary of my published work on my Google Scholar profile [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9FhHossAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), or you can contact me to learn more about ongoing research across these domains.

## Teamwork

_What composition, behaviors, and conditions elicit the most effective teamwork?_

My work in this area has spanned across a variety of topics in the teams domain, including team safety and team training and industries such as healthcare and engineering. Related to my work on team diversity, I am also interested in new approaches to conceptualizing team phenomena. 


## Diversity and Inclusion

_How can we prepare employees to work effectively across demographic boundaries to improve interactions in the workplace?_

My research in the diversity and inclusion domain focuses primarily on intergroup relations in workplace settings. For example, I have conducted research focused on cross-cultural and diversity training as this area is ripe for exploring the ways in which workplace interventions can be used to improve relationships between individuals from different demographic groups.

## Team Diversity

_How can organizations facilitate effective teamwork?_

Blending these two research areas, my independent work focuses primarily on team demographic diversity. My research funded by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship focuses on exploring how team demographic composition and a team’s attitudes, behaviors, and cognition impact career outcomes for women in engineering. Building off of this work, I have led efforts to explore these ideas more thoroughly. This work is currently underway, and has received funding from the National Science Foundation Science of Organizations and Rice University’s Doerr Institute for New Leaders.

  Hi, my name is Allison Traylor. I'm a second year doctoral student in Industrial/Organizational Psychology at Rice University and a National Science Foundation graduate research fellow. I earned my bachelor's degree *summa cum laude* from Northeastern University in 2017.

  This is my personal and professional website. It's currently under construction, but you can check back soon for more on what I've been up to lately! If you need to contact me, please email allison.m.traylor@rice.edu.

<div class="lead lead-about">I’m Allison Traylor, a doctoral student in industrial-organizational (I/O) psychology at Rice University and a Graduate Research Fellow of the National Science Foundation.
</div>

I am a proud native of Louisville (Loo-uh-vuhl), Kentucky, and though I’ve lost my local touch, I still travel there frequently to visit my family. I received my Bachelor’s degree in Management and Political Science from Northeastern University in Boston, where I graduated summa cum laude with honors in business administration. After graduating, I moved to Houston, Texas to pursue my Ph.D. under the advisement of Dr. Eduardo Salas.

I was inspired to pursue a Ph.D. in I/O psychology much to the thanks of Dr. Paula Caligiuri, my undergraduate mentor who introduced me to academic research. While at Northeastern, I participated in two co-ops (full-time, six-month work experiences) at the National Center on Time and Learning and the TJX Companies. My work in these applied settings demonstrated the practical impact of work in this realm, solidifying my desire to pursue a career in I/O. However, I hope to pursue a career as a faculty member at a reserach-oriented university so that I can generate reserach that will help organizations like the ones I worked at.
